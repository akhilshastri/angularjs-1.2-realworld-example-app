# (WIP)

> ### AngularJS 1.2 codebase containing real world examples of the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

This repo is work in progress.

### [Demo]()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

Dispite the glearing success of Angular 2 / 4 / 5 etc. The old school project known as AngularJS is still popular and wideliy use by software companies all around the world. This version of the library support IE 8.

The library does not support component driven development so the only building block of the web application are:
- controllers
- directives
- services

In this example application I am going to include the source code of custom build tool developed with nodejs scripts and some external libraries for convinians.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

## Application Libraries
- AngularJS 1.2.*
- UI-Router 1.6.*

## Build script

## Virtual container
The applica is shiped and distributed usingvirtual container Vagrant for convinins. The vagrant is not nesesary in order to run the application. But in this section I am going to describe how to set up the local Vagrant environment.

* TODO

# Getting started

## Installation
